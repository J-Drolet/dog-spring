## About
This project was created by me  to furthur my understanding of SpringBoot, RESTful APIs, and software architecture. DogSpring was motivated as being a jumping off point for furthur development and technologies. Possible expansions include 
- Implementing real databases for storing User and Dog information
- Implementing authentication for users
- Adding more complicated game mechanics
- Trading with other users
